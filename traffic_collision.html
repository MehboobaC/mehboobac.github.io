							One of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities globally is traffic accidents.
							Consequently, they make up a substantial area of research.
							A number of factors increase the likelihood of crashes including weather, road design, vehicle design, alcohol use and aggressive driving.
							In addition to these considerations, there can be some underlying patterns in the time of collision.
							A time series analysis can be used to uncover this underlying pattern. 
							The purpose of this project is to predict the number of collisions using the time series analysis.

							This is a simple Flask app for monthly traffic collision prediction based on univariate time series analysis.
							The trained model(web/model.pkl) takes date as input and predict the no.of collisions per month. 
							<br> Tools : Python( Flask, Numpy, Pandas,), HTML, CSS, Power BI
							<br><br>The project is divided into three parts. <hr>

							<ol>
								<li> Exploring the data to find insights.</li>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>Dataset have ~551K rows and 18 columns</li>
										<li>"DR Number" was unique for each row</li>
										<li>"Time Occured" column was dirty and it had value from 1 to 2359. This column was cleaned to merge with "Date occured" column</li>
										<li>Cleaned victim sex and victim descent columns to replace wrong entries</li>
										<li>Extracted Area ID corresponding to different areas in "area name" column</li>
										<li>Extracted premise code for each premise discription</li>
										<li>Crime code and crime code had only 1 unique value indicating traffic collision</li>
										<li>Location column had 740 entries with value (0.0, 0.0)</li>
										<li>MO Code contains different codes in single cell seperated by space. Since MO Code is used to describe the traffic collision details, these codes were extracted to find the collision details.</li>
									
									</ul><hr>
								<li> Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>Age column data is skewed towards the right. There are hardly any victims below age 15.Most victims are in their 20s.
											The number of collision victims per age generally decreases after age 30.
											There are spikes at most multiples of 5 (25, 30, 35, etc).
											This suggests that some ages are estimated and that official identification (such as a driver’s license) isn’t always used in collision reports.Age 99 seems to be a catch-all bucket.
											It seems unlikely that there are actually as many age-99 victims as are shown above. This plot also raises questions, how are collisions with multiple victims dealt with and what’s going on with the spike at age 99. </li>
										<li>From the area-collision count plot, it is clear that 77th street has most no. of collisions and Foothill area have least no. of collisions.
											 Southwest area also have more no.of collisions. Some areas obviously have more collisions than others.
											 But without additional information such as size or traffic density per area, this graphic isn’t too informative.</li>
										<li>Most no. of victims are from H(Hispanic/Latin/Mexican). The white people are also more in the no. of victims.
											There are only a few victims of Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
											Cambodian, Pacific Islander, Guamanian, Laotian, Samoan and Hawaiian.
											There are also a significant no. of victims from unknown descent.</li>
										<li>The no. of collisions are approximately the same from 2010 to 2014.
											There  is a significant increase in the no. of collisions from 2014 to 2019.
											The sudden increase in collision count can be either due to the proper implementation of traffic collision data collision or due to the sudden increase in traffic during these years.
											In 2020, there is a significant decrease in the no.of collisions, may be due to  the decrease in traffic due to corona pandemic.
											2021 has lesser collisions as data has values up to date 9th January 2021.
										</li>
										<li>Most no. of collisions occurred during March and October and
											 Least no.of collisions are there in February and April</li>
										<li>Collisions are increasing from Sunday to Friday, with a sharp increase from Thursday to Friday and at their weekly minimum on Sunday and maximum on Friday.
											 This indicates a presence of weekly seasonality in the data. By analysing the data for Friday on hourly collisions, we can find the peak hour in friday.
											  There may be many reasons for the increase in collisions on Friday.
											 This can be identified by analysing other social factors and can be used to implement counter measures to reduce the no.of collisions.</li>
										<li> 58.15% collision victims are males and 37.54% are females. There is also 4.31% unknown sex victims. </li>
										<li>collisions are sharply increasing from ~4am to ~8am, decreasing from ~8am to ~9am, generally increasing from ~9am to ~5pm and sharply decreasing from ~5pm to ~4am.
											 No. of collisions have their daily minimum at ~4am and daily maximum at ~5pm.</li>
										<li>By analysing the premise column, it is clear that most of the collisions occurred in the street.
											 Proper measures needs to be taken in order to reduce the no.of collision in street.
											  There is no availability in the data regarding pedestrians were involved or not. This needs further attention. Also parking lot has second most no.of reported collisions.
											 Collisions in parking lot can be generally minor as it may occurred during parking. </li>
										<li>In 2018, peoples with 18 years old caused more no.of collisions and in 2019, peoples with 19 years old caused more no.of collisions.
											 Therefore, this age group requires further attention and they must be analysed accordingly.
											 Proper awareness programme or policies must be taken in to action for this age group. </li>
										<li>People with in the age 15 to 20 and 99 years is mainly denoted as unknown sex.</li>
									</ul><hr>
								<li> Training a univariate time series model for monthly traffic collision prediction.</li>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li> A dataframe is created from the traffic collision data with date as index as monthly collision as feature </li>
										<li> From the descriptive statistics of the target column, it is clear the minimum no.of collisions in a month was 2429 and maximum no.of collisions was 5285. The average no.of collisions in a month is 4170. The data set for building the model contains 132 months data.</li>
										<li> The no.of collisions between 2010 and 2014 is almost linear. There is a significant increase in the no. of collisions from 2014 to 2019. In 2020, there is a fall in the no. of collisions, which may be due to the corona pandemic.</li>
										<li> Here the trend of the target column varies over time. Therefore, multiplicative modelling is used for decomposition to understand time series components seperately</li>
										<li> Plotted autocorrelation(ACF) and partial autocorrelation(PACF) and checked for stationarity of time series data using Dickey Fuller Test.</li>
										<li> Used log transformation to stabilize the variance of the series. Removed linear trend using first differencing method and seasonality using seasonal differencing.</li>
										<li> Applied ARIMA and FB prophet models for prediction. FB prophet model resulted in rmse value less than 1000 whereas ARIMA model got rmse value of ~1006.</li>

								<li> Building a Flask web app for end user.</li>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li> Used model.pkl file to predict the count of monthly collisions</li>
